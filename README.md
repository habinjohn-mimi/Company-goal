## Customization

### Adding New Features
The modular structure makes it easy to extend:
- Add new chart types in the `initializeCharts()` method

### Data Storage
- Currently uses localStorage for simplicity
- Can be easily modified to use a backend API
- Export/import functionality for data migration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Subgoal percentages don't equal 100%**
   - Ensure all subgoal percentages add up to exactly 100%
   - Check for decimal precision issues

2. **Charts not displaying**
   - Ensure Chart.js is loaded properly
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

3. **Data not persisting**
   - Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
   - Clear browser cache if needed

4. **Export not working**
   - Ensure browser supports Blob API
   - Check if popup blockers are enabled
